描述
The binary weight of a positive  integer is the number of 1's in its binary representation.for example,the decmial number 1 has a binary weight of 1,and the decimal number 1717 (which is 11010110101 in binary) has a binary weight of 7.Give a positive integer N,return the smallest integer greater than N that has the same binary weight as N.N will be between 1 and 1000000000,inclusive,the result is guaranteed to fit in a signed 32-bit interget.

输入
